    <h1 id="h1"><strong>Project Description</strong></h1>
        <p id="p1">All too often people are drawn to cities, movie theatres, shopping malls, but what about all the natural areas that were here first? As a natural resource steward, I am here to further our information on these amazing parks and forests, as well as show you them. The greatest thing about what I do, is that I get to facilitate learning about fascinating natural areas and the wildlife that inhabits them through leading edge software and mapping programs.  </p>
        
        
        <p id="p1">Through this project, I hope to accurately and appropriately map our countries most pristine and natural areas. I want to help others see the beauty these lands hold and to respect how much natural resource managers have done to maintain these areas. As mentioned above, I think that sometimes society forgets about these areas because their 9-5 job doesn’t lead them there. These are prairies, forests, and mountains that have been here since way before we colonized America. </p>
        
        <p id="p1">I plan to use leaflet to display the map with natural areas on it. GitHub is where I will store all my data and files used to create my map. I will use QGIS to format shapefiles into GeoJSON files. I may also possibly use ArcGIS Pro to query and export data. I intend to use plugins such as esri-leaflet and cluster points. I intend to add in this ArcGIS Rest Serve from the NPS website (<a id="SecondLink"; href="https://services1.arcgis.com/fBc8EJBxQRMcHlei/ArcGIS/rest/services/NPS_Park_Boundaries/FeatureServer/0" title="NPS_Park_Boundaries" color="green" target="blank">Link</a>), online API. From there, I will go to the arcgis.com page to download the file. Then I can convert it to a geojson in QGIS and create a cluster marker portion of my final map. I plan to include, National parks,<br> <a id="SecondLink"; href="https://services2.arcgis.com/FiaPA4ga0iQKduv3/ArcGIS/rest/services/US_Forest_Service_Administrative_Forest_Boundaries/FeatureServer/0" title="Administrative Forest Boundaries" color="green" target="blank">National Forests</a>, State Parks of Iowa, Cities, and a state’s layer (all from Iowa Geodata).</p>
        
        <p id="p1">Hopefully, after learning about these natural areas and Iowa’s current environmental issues, I can spread awareness to people of different backgrounds. This is something I have studied and worked with for around two years now, so I am very passionate about it.</p>
